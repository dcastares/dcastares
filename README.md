### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**dcastares/dcastares** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working building Wordpress websites and games in Unity.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning french.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m collaborating with the YouTube channel "Por una vez que nos juntamos" (check it out!) 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about photography, always looking for new angles to document stuff.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: diego.castares@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: As a teen I tought I was going to be a musician, the time tought me it is an amazing hobby, but I wasn't gifted enough to make it my profession.
